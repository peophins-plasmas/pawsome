    "behavior": "Lola is nervous around loud noises and startles easily. She doesn't like vacuums, cars, trucks, or any loud street noises. She's a nervous walker, so her walker needs to be confident and okay with moving her along, and encouraging her to walk. She will try and turn back and run towards home, but she can be convinced to keep going. Walks during quieter hours(morning and night), are easier, so it's okay to keep midday walks on the shorter side. Otherwise, she is an angel, great with other dogs, cats, and people, she prefers to hang with humans, she can be picked up and loves to snuggle. She is food motivated, and will try to eat your food and the food of other dogs, but she has never bitten a human or animal, she's just sneaky. The only time she really growls is when she wants food, or if she has a rawhide bone and you come near her she'll grow, but would not bite. She is an overly aggressive licker, but just needs to be told to stop and back off and she will get the hint, if you don't stop her she could do it ALL day, be warned.",

Whenever the litterboxes are being cleaned, he will come to whichever one is being scooped and try to use it in the process, so you might as well let him do it. He is obsessed with food and can open doors so you need to lock the door when you are cooking and eating. He tends to finish his sibling's food. He will come to you often and rub his head on you then attempt to lure you to his food bowl to refill it. Stick to the feeding schedule. Otherwise he is a good boy.",
